# Multi-School Complete Implementation Guide

## üî¥ CRITICAL BUG FIX (v1.0.7)

**Issue**: Multi-school authentication was failing with 401 error when selecting a specific school.

**Root Cause**: The salt endpoint returns **different salts** depending on the `institutionId` parameter. When re-authenticating with a specific school after detecting multiple schools, the code was reusing the salt fetched with `institutionId: null`, causing authentication to fail.

**Fix**: Modified `_get_salt()` to accept and pass through the `institution_id` parameter. Now the salt is correctly refetched with the institution_id before re-authentication.

**Affected Users**: Only accounts with access to multiple schools (children at different schools).

---

## Executive Summary

**Account Tested**: `wunsch@gmx.de`  
**Institution ID**: `13309`  
**Student ID**: `4333047` (Marc Cedric Wunsch)  
**Multi-School Status**: ‚ùå **Single school account** (no `multipleAccounts` response)

**Key Finding**: This account accesses only ONE school. The `institutionId` is returned in the user object and must be stored/reused for session persistence across HA restarts.

---

## Test Results from curl API Testing

### Test 1: Login WITHOUT institutionId
```bash
POST /api/login
{
  "emailOrUsername": "wunsch@gmx.de",
  "hash": "...",
  "institutionId": null
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 2385948,
    "firstname": "Marc Cedric",
    "lastname": "Wunsch",
    "institutionId": 13309,  ‚Üê Returned in user object
    "associatedParents": [
      {
        "student": {
          "id": 4333047,
          "firstname": "Marc Cedric",
          "lastname": "Wunsch",
          "classId": 444612
          ‚Üê NO institutionId field in student!
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "jwt": "eyJhbGci..."
}
```

**Observations**:
- ‚úÖ Login successful with JWT token
- ‚úÖ `institutionId: 13309` present in `user` object
- ‚ùå NO `multipleAccounts` response (single school account)
- ‚ùå Student object does NOT contain `institutionId` field

### Test 2: Login WITH institutionId=13309
```bash
POST /api/login
{
  "emailOrUsername": "wunsch@gmx.de",
  "hash": "...",
  "institutionId": 13309
}
```

**Response**: Identical to Test 1
- Same user data
- Same JWT token structure
- Same student data (no `institutionId` in student)

**Conclusion**: Passing `institutionId` explicitly doesn't change the response for single-school accounts, but it ensures the API knows which school to authenticate against (critical for multi-school accounts).

## Multi-School Architecture Analysis

### NEW Implementation (v2.0+) ‚úÖ AUTOMATIC MULTI-SCHOOL

**Storage Level**: Config Entry (Account Level) with Multiple Schools
```python
entry.data = {
    "email": "wunsch@gmx.de",
    "password": "***",
    "schools": [
        {"id": 13309, "name": "Gymnasium M√ºnchen"},
        {"id": 14520, "name": "Realschule Berlin"}
    ]
}
```

**What Changed**:
1. ‚úÖ **No more school selection step** - all schools are collected automatically
2. ‚úÖ Students have `_institution_id` and `_institution_name` fields added
3. ‚úÖ Multiple API instances created (one per school) 
4. ‚úÖ API calls are routed to the correct school automatically
5. ‚úÖ **One config entry = All students from all schools**

### Supported Scenarios

| Scenario | Supported? | Solution |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| One account, multiple children at **same** school | ‚úÖ Yes | One config entry (auto-detects single school) |
| One account, multiple children at **different** schools | ‚úÖ Yes | **One config entry (NEW: auto-collects all schools!)** |
| Multi-school account (returns `multipleAccounts`) | ‚úÖ Yes | **Automatic - no user selection needed** |

### Multi-School Flow (Automatic)

**Step 1: Initial Login** (`institutionId: null`)
```json
GET /api/get-salt with {"institutionId": null}
‚Üí Returns salt

POST /api/login with {"institutionId": null, "hash": "..."}
‚Üí Response: {
  "multipleAccounts": [
    {"id": 13309, "label": "Gymnasium M√ºnchen"},
    {"id": 14520, "label": "Realschule Berlin"}
  ]
}
```
- Multi-school account detected
- **No user interaction needed - proceeding to collect from all schools**

**Step 2: Automatic Collection from All Schools**

For each school in `multipleAccounts`:

```json
School 1 (Gymnasium M√ºnchen):
GET /api/get-salt with {"institutionId": 13309}
‚Üí Returns school-specific salt

POST /api/login with {"institutionId": 13309, "hash": "..."}
‚Üí Response: {"jwt": "token_school_13309", "user": {associatedParents: [...]}}
‚Üí Students: Alice, Bob (both get _institution_id: 13309)

School 2 (Realschule Berlin):
GET /api/get-salt with {"institutionId": 14520}
‚Üí Returns school-specific salt

POST /api/login with {"institutionId": 14520, "hash": "..."}
‚Üí Response: {"jwt": "token_school_14520", "user": {associatedParents: [...]}}
‚Üí Students: Carol (gets _institution_id: 14520)
```

**Result**:
- One config entry created
- Three students total (Alice, Bob, Carol)
- Two API instances (one per school)
- All students accessible in Home Assistant

**Why is this better?**
1. **Simpler UX** - No school selection, user just enters credentials once
2. **Complete data** - All children from all schools in one setup
3. **Transparent** - User sees all students with their school names
4. **Fewer config entries** - No need to add integration multiple times

Using the salt from Step 1 (fetched with `institutionId: null`) will result in a **401 Unauthorized** error.

**Step 3: Subsequent HA Restarts**
- Read `institutionId` from `entry.data`
- Pass to `api.authenticate(institution_id=...)`
- API will fetch institution-specific salt and authenticate
- Session continues with same school

## Implementation Details

### API Client (`api.py`)

#### Storage
```python
class SchulmanagerAPI:
    def __init__(self, email: str, password: str, session):
        self.email = email
        self.password = password
        self.institution_id: Optional[int] = None  # Runtime storage
        self.multiple_accounts: Optional[List[Dict]] = None
```

#### Authentication Method
```python
async def authenticate(self, *, institution_id: Optional[int] = None):
    """Authenticate with optional institutionId for multi-school accounts."""
    # CRITICAL: Pass institution_id to salt request for multi-school accounts
    salt = await self._get_salt(institution_id=institution_id)
    hash = self._generate_salted_hash(self.password, salt)
    await self._login(hash, institution_id=institution_id)
```

#### Salt Retrieval
```python
async def _get_salt(self, *, institution_id: Optional[int] = None) -> str:
    """Get salt for password hashing. Pass institution_id for multi-school accounts."""
    payload = {
        "emailOrUsername": self.email,
        "mobileApp": False,
        "institutionId": institution_id,  # CRITICAL: Must include for multi-school
    }
    
    response = await self.session.post(SALT_URL, json=payload)
    # ... handle response
```

#### Login Handler
```python
async def _login(self, salted_hash: str, *, institution_id: Optional[int] = None):
    payload = {
        "emailOrUsername": self.email,
        "password": self.password,
        "hash": salted_hash,
        "mobileApp": False,
        "institutionId": institution_id,  # Pass through
    }
    
    response = await self.session.post(LOGIN_URL, json=payload)
    data = await response.json()
    
    # Check for multi-school response
    if "multipleAccounts" in data:
        self.multiple_accounts = data["multipleAccounts"]
        self.token = None  # No token yet
        return
    
    # Standard response
    self.token = data.get("jwt")
    
    # Store institutionId
    if institution_id is not None:
        self.institution_id = institution_id
    else:
        # Extract from user data
        self.institution_id = data.get("user", {}).get("institutionId")
```

### Config Flow (`config_flow.py`)

#### Initial Login Step
```python
async def async_step_user(self, user_input):
    api = SchulmanagerAPI(email, password, session)
    await api.authenticate()  # No institutionId yet
    
    # Check for multi-school
    if api.get_multiple_accounts():
        self._multiple_accounts = api.get_multiple_accounts()
        return await self.async_step_select_school()
    
    # Single school - continue with standard flow
    students = await api.get_students()
    ...
```

#### School Selection Step (Multi-School Only)
```python
async def async_step_select_school(self, user_input=None):
    if user_input is None:
        # Show dropdown
        choices = {
            str(acc["id"]): acc["label"]
            for acc in self._multiple_accounts
        }
        schema = vol.Schema({
            vol.Required("institution_id"): vol.In(choices)
        })
        return self.async_show_form(step_id="select_school", data_schema=schema)
    
    # Re-authenticate with selected school
    inst_id = int(user_input["institution_id"])
    api = SchulmanagerAPI(email, password, session)
    await api.authenticate(institution_id=inst_id)
    
    # Store in config entry data
    self._data["institution_id"] = inst_id
    
    return self.async_create_entry(data=self._data)
```

### Integration Setup (`__init__.py`) ‚úÖ FIXED

#### Reading Stored institutionId
```python
async def async_setup_entry(hass: HomeAssistant, entry: ConfigEntry):
    email = entry.data[CONF_EMAIL]
    password = entry.data[CONF_PASSWORD]
    institution_id = entry.data.get("institution_id")  # ‚Üê CRITICAL FIX
    
    api = SchulmanagerAPI(email, password, session)
    
    # Use stored institutionId on every authentication
    await api.authenticate(institution_id=institution_id)
    
    students = await api.get_students()
    ...
```

**Fix Applied**: We now read `institution_id` from storage and pass it to `authenticate()` on every HA restart.

---

## Hash Generation (Critical Implementation Detail)

**MUST use exactly 99,999 iterations** (not 10,000):

```python
def _generate_salted_hash(self, password: str, salt: str) -> str:
    password_bytes = password.encode('utf-8')
    salt_bytes = salt.encode('utf-8')
    
    # PBKDF2-SHA512: 99999 iterations, 512 bytes output
    hash_bytes = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac(
        'sha512', 
        password_bytes, 
        salt_bytes, 
        99999,  # ‚Üê Critical: must be 99999
        dklen=512
    )
    
    return hash_bytes.hex()  # 1024 hex characters
```

---

## API Endpoints Reference

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | institutionId Location |
|----------|--------|---------|----------------------|
| `/api/get-salt` | POST | Get salt for hashing | Payload: `{"institutionId": null \| 123}` ‚ö†Ô∏è MUST match login! |
| `/api/login` | POST | Authenticate | Payload: `{"institutionId": null \| 123}` |
| `/api/calls` | POST | All data requests | Implicit in JWT token |

**Key Insights**: 
1. The salt endpoint returns **different salts** depending on the `institutionId` parameter
2. Once authenticated with an `institutionId`, the JWT token is **scoped to that institution**
3. All subsequent API calls use that token without needing to pass `institutionId` explicitly
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL BUG FIX** (v1.0.7): For multi-school accounts, the salt MUST be fetched with the same `institutionId` used for login, otherwise authentication fails with 401

---

## Testing Multi-School Accounts

### Prerequisites
- Account with access to multiple schools
- Initial login returns `multipleAccounts` response

### Test Script Available

**Primary Debug Script** (Recommended):
```bash
cd test-scripts

# Test basic login - detects single vs multi-school
python3 debug_multi_school.py --email your@email.com --password 'your_password'

# Test with specific institutionId (for multi-school accounts)
python3 debug_multi_school.py --email your@email.com --password 'your_password' --institution-id 13309

# Full API endpoint testing
python3 debug_multi_school.py --email your@email.com --password 'your_password' --full-test

# Anonymize student names in output files
python3 debug_multi_school.py --email your@email.com --password 'your_password' --anonymize-names
```

**Script Output**:
- Detects single vs multi-school accounts
- Shows available schools with IDs
- Tests authentication with specific institution
- Validates student data structure
- Saves redacted debug files to `test-scripts/debug-dumps/`
- Provides clear instructions for reporting issues

**Script Features**:
- ‚úÖ Automatic data redaction (passwords, tokens, emails)
- ‚úÖ Multi-school detection and guidance
- ‚úÖ Full API endpoint testing (with `--full-test`)
- ‚úÖ Student name anonymization (with `--anonymize-names`)
- ‚úÖ Safe to share output files with developers

For detailed usage, see: [Debug Script Guide](Debug_Script_Guide.md)

### Debugging in Home Assistant

Enable debug logging in `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.schulmanager_online: debug
    custom_components.schulmanager_online.api: debug
    custom_components.schulmanager_online.config_flow: debug
```

**Look for these key messages**:
- `Probing for multi-school account (institutionId=None)` - Initial detection
- `Multi-school account detected with X schools` - Success! School dropdown should appear
- `Single-school account detected` - Normal flow
- `Multi-school probe failed: ...` - **BUG**: Detection failed
- `User selected institution ID: 12345` - School selection
- `Re-authenticating with institution_id=12345` - Re-auth with selected school
- `Successfully authenticated with institution 12345, found N students` - Success

### Download Diagnostics (Built-in Feature)

**Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Schulmanager Online ‚Üí ‚ãÆ ‚Üí Download Diagnostics**

This provides:
- Configuration data (auto-redacted)
- Multi-school detection status
- Institution ID from config
- Student count and structure (names redacted)
- API connection status
- Last errors

**This file is SAFE to share** - all sensitive data is automatically redacted.

## Common Questions & Answers

### Q: Do students have their own `institutionId`?
**A**: ‚ùå No. Students do NOT have an `institutionId` field based on testing.

### Q: Can one config entry support multiple schools?
**A**: ‚ùå No, by design. Each config entry = One school session.

### Q: How to support children at different schools?
**A**: Add the integration multiple times (once per school).

### Q: Does passing `institutionId` change the JWT token?
**A**: No, the JWT is the same structure, but it's **scoped** to that institution.

### Q: What if I don't pass `institutionId` for a multi-school account?
**A**: You get `multipleAccounts` response instead of a JWT token. Must select a school and re-login.

### Q: Is `institutionId` required for single-school accounts?
**A**: No, but it's returned in the user data and can be passed (doesn't hurt).

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users
If your integration was set up before the fix:
1. Your `institutionId` is NOT currently being used on HA restart
2. Login still works because the API extracts it from user data
3. **Fix deployed**: Now correctly reads and uses stored `institutionId`
4. No action needed - will work correctly after update

### For New Multi-School Users
1. Add integration in HA
2. Enter credentials
3. **If multi-school**: Select school from dropdown
4. Integration stores `institutionId` automatically
5. Works correctly across HA restarts

---

## Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] Integration loads without errors
- [ ] Students appear correctly
- [ ] HA restart maintains login (no re-prompting)
- [ ] Check logs for `institutionId: 13309` on authentication
- [ ] All entities update normally

---

## Conclusion

**Current Implementation Status**: ‚úÖ **CORRECT & COMPLETE**

Our implementation:
1. ‚úÖ Correctly stores `institutionId` at config entry level
2. ‚úÖ Handles multi-school accounts via selection flow
3. ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Now reads and uses stored `institutionId` on HA restart
4. ‚úÖ Matches Schulmanager API design (one session = one school)
5. ‚úÖ Supports multiple students at same school
6. ‚úÖ Supports multiple schools via multiple config entries

**No architecture changes needed** - the current design correctly reflects how Schulmanager's API works.
