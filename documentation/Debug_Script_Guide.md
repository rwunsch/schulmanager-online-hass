# Debug Script User Guide

## What is this tool?

The **Schulmanager Online Debug Script** is a diagnostic tool that helps identify and fix multi-school login issues with the Home Assistant integration. It's designed to be run **outside of Home Assistant** on your computer.

### When to use this tool:

‚úÖ **Use this if:**
- Your Schulmanager integration isn't loading in Home Assistant
- You have children at multiple schools and the integration isn't working
- You want to verify your credentials before setting up the integration
- A developer asked you to run diagnostics

‚ùå **Don't need this if:**
- Your integration is working fine
- You just want to set up the integration (use the HA UI instead)

---

## üîí Privacy & Security

**This script is SAFE to use and share results from:**

‚úÖ **What IS redacted (hidden)**:
- Your password (NEVER saved to files)
- JWT authentication tokens (only last 8 characters shown)
- Email addresses (partially masked: `u***@e***.com`)
- Hash values

‚úÖ **What CAN be shared**:
- The output files in `debug-dumps/` folder
- These files are automatically cleaned of sensitive data
- Safe to attach to GitHub issues or send to developers

‚ùå **What you should NOT share**:
- Your actual password (never needed by developers)
- The console output if you used `--anonymize-names` flag
  (it may show real names on screen, but files will be anonymized)

---

## Advanced Usage

### Multi-School Account

If the script detects multiple schools:

```bash
# First run (to see available schools)
python3 debug_multi_school.py --email your@email.com --password 'YourPassword'

# Output will show:
#   ‚ö†Ô∏è  MULTI-SCHOOL ACCOUNT DETECTED!
#   Found 2 schools:
#      - ID: 12345  Name: Elementary School A
#      - ID: 67890  Name: High School B

# Second run (select specific school)
python3 debug_multi_school.py --email your@email.com --password 'YourPassword' --institution-id 12345
```

### Full API Test

To test all API endpoints (schedule, homework, exams, etc.):

```bash
python3 debug_multi_school.py --email your@email.com --password 'YourPassword' --full-test
```

This will:
- Test schedule retrieval
- Test homework retrieval
- Test exams retrieval
- Test letters/messages
- Save all responses to `debug-dumps/` folder

### Anonymize Student Names

If you want to keep student names private when sharing debug files:

```bash
python3 debug_multi_school.py --email your@email.com --password 'YourPassword' --anonymize-names
```

Student names will be replaced with: `[STUDENT_123]`, `[STUDENT_456]`, etc.

## Understanding the Output

### Console Output

**‚úì Green checkmarks** = Everything is working correctly
**‚ö†Ô∏è  Yellow warnings** = Something unexpected (but might be OK)
**‚úó Red errors** = Something is wrong

### Key Information to Note:

1. **Institution ID**: e.g., `13309`
   - This is YOUR school's unique identifier
   - You'll need this if filing a bug report

2. **User ID**: e.g., `2385948`
   - Your account's unique identifier

3. **Student IDs**: e.g., `4333047`
   - Each child's unique identifier

4. **Multi-School Status**:
   - **Single School**: Most common, means you access one school
   - **Multi-School**: You have access to multiple schools (rare)

### Output Files

Files are saved to: `test-scripts/debug-dumps/`

| File | What It Contains |
|------|------------------|
| `01_get_salt_response.json` | Salt used for password hashing |
| `02_login_response.json` | Login API response (token redacted) |
| `03_login_parsed_user.json` | Your user data and students (safe to share) |
| `10_schedule_response.json` | Schedule data (if --full-test used) |
| `12_homework_response.json` | Homework data (if --full-test used) |
| `13_exams_response.json` | Exams data (if --full-test used) |
| `14_letters_response.json` | Letters/messages (if --full-test used) |

**All files are automatically redacted** - passwords and tokens are removed!

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "No module named 'requests'"

**Solution**: Install the requests library:
```bash
pip3 install requests
```

### Error: "Login failed: 401" or "Unauthorized"

**Possible causes**:
1. Wrong email or password
2. Copy-paste error (trailing spaces)
3. Password contains special characters not escaped

**Solution**: 
- Double-check your credentials
- Try wrapping password in single quotes: `'Password123!'`
- If password has a single quote, escape it: `'Pass'\''word'`

### Error: "Multiple schools present, please re-run with --institution-id"

This is **EXPECTED** if you have access to multiple schools!

**Solution**:
1. Note the school IDs shown in the output
2. Re-run with the ID of the school you want to test:
   ```bash
   python3 debug_multi_school.py --email ... --password ... --institution-id 12345
   ```

### Script hangs or takes a long time

**Solution**:
- Check your internet connection
- Schulmanager servers might be slow or down
- Press `Ctrl+C` to cancel and try again later

## FAQ

### Q: Will this script make changes to my Schulmanager account?
**A**: No! This script only READS data. It never writes or modifies anything.

### Q: Can I run this on my Home Assistant server?
**A**: You can, but it's designed to run on your regular computer. If running on HA server, you might need to install Python packages differently.

### Q: How long does the script take to run?
**A**: Usually 5-15 seconds for basic test, 30-60 seconds with `--full-test`.

### Q: Do I need to run this if the integration is working?
**A**: No! This is only for diagnostics when something is broken.

### Q: What if I have multiple children at different schools?
**A**: The script will detect this! Run it once for each school using different `--institution-id` values.

### Q: Is this the same as the integration?
**A**: No! This is a standalone diagnostic tool. The actual integration runs inside Home Assistant.
