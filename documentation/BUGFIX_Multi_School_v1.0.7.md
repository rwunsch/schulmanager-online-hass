# Bug Fix: Multi-School Authentication (v1.0.7)

## Issue Summary

**GitHub Issue**: [#1 - Ich kann mich nicht anmelden](https://github.com/rwunsch/schulmanager-online-hass/issues/1)

**Problem**: Users with multi-school accounts (children at different schools) were unable to authenticate after selecting a specific school. The authentication would fail with a **401 Unauthorized** error.

### User Report

The affected user reported:
- Account has 2 children in different schools
- Initial login detects 2 schools correctly:
  - ID: 358798 - Herzog-Tassilo-Realschule Erding
  - ID: 2509609 - Erzbisch√∂fliche M√§dchenrealschule Heilig Blut Erding
- When re-authenticating with a specific institution ID, login fails with 401 error

## Root Cause

The Schulmanager API's `/api/get-salt` endpoint returns **different salts** depending on the `institutionId` parameter passed in the request.

### What Was Happening

    Client->>API: POST /api/login with Salt A hash + institutionId=null
    API->>Client: multipleAccounts response
    
    Note over Client: Step 2: Re-auth (BROKEN)
    Note over Client: ‚ùå Reusing Salt A!
    Client->>API: POST /api/login with Salt A hash + institutionId=358798
    API->>Client: ‚ùå 401 Unauthorized
```

### What Should Happen

    API->>Client: multipleAccounts response
    
    Note over Client: Step 2: Re-auth (FIXED)
    Client->>API: POST /api/get-salt {"institutionId": 358798}
    API->>Client: Salt B (different!)
    Client->>API: POST /api/login with Salt B hash + institutionId=358798
    API->>Client: ‚úÖ JWT token + user data
```

## The Fix

### Changes Made

#### 1. API Client (`custom_components/schulmanager_online/api.py`)

**Modified `_get_salt()` method** to accept and pass through `institution_id`:

```python
# BEFORE (v1.0.6)
async def _get_salt(self) -> str:
    """Get salt for password hashing."""
    payload = {
        "emailOrUsername": self.email,
        "mobileApp": False,
        "institutionId": None  # ‚ùå Always null!
    }
    # ...

# AFTER (v1.0.7)
async def _get_salt(self, *, institution_id: Optional[int] = None) -> str:
    """Get salt for password hashing. Pass institution_id for multi-school accounts."""
    payload = {
        "emailOrUsername": self.email,
        "mobileApp": False,
        "institutionId": institution_id  # ‚úÖ Passed through!
    }
    # ...
```

**Modified `authenticate()` method** to pass `institution_id` to salt request:

```python
# BEFORE (v1.0.6)
async def authenticate(self, *, institution_id: Optional[int] = None) -> None:
    salt = await self._get_salt()  # ‚ùå No institution_id
    salted_hash = self._generate_salted_hash(self.password, salt)
    await self._login(salted_hash, institution_id=institution_id)

# AFTER (v1.0.7)
async def authenticate(self, *, institution_id: Optional[int] = None) -> None:
    salt = await self._get_salt(institution_id=institution_id)  # ‚úÖ Passed!
    salted_hash = self._generate_salted_hash(self.password, salt)
    await self._login(salted_hash, institution_id=institution_id)
```

#### 2. Debug Script (`test-scripts/debug_multi_school.py`)

Updated the test script to **refetch salt with institution_id** when re-authenticating:

```python
# When multi-school detected and institution_id specified:
print(f"Step 3b/5: Re-fetching salt with Institution ID {selected_inst_id}...")
salt = get_salt(args.email, institution_id=selected_inst_id)  # ‚úÖ NEW!

print(f"Step 3c/5: Re-computing hash with institution-specific salt...")
hash_hex = pbkdf2_sha512_hex(args.password, salt)  # ‚úÖ NEW!

print(f"Step 3d/5: Re-authenticating with Institution ID {selected_inst_id}...")
data = login(args.email, args.password, hash_hex, institution_id=selected_inst_id)
```

#### 3. Documentation Updates

Updated the following documentation files:
- `Multi_School_Complete_Guide.md`: Added critical bug fix section and updated flow diagrams
- `Authentication_Guide.md`: Added multi-school salt retrieval examples

## Testing Instructions

### For Users with Multi-School Accounts

1. **Update to v1.0.7**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/wunsch/git/schulmanager-online-hass
   git pull
   ```

2. **Test with debug script**:
   ```bash
   python3 test-scripts/debug_multi_school.py \
     --email your@email.com \
     --password 'your_password' \
     --institution-id 358798
   ```

3. **Expected output**:
   ```
   Step 1/5: Fetching salt for password hashing...
            ‚úì Salt received (468 characters)

   Step 2/5: Computing PBKDF2-SHA512 hash (99,999 iterations)...
            ‚úì Hash computed (1024 characters)

   Step 3/5: Testing login (checking for multiple schools)...
            ‚ö†Ô∏è  MULTI-SCHOOL ACCOUNT DETECTED!
            Found 2 schools:
               - ID: 358798  Name: Herzog-Tassilo-Realschule Erding
               - ID: 2509609  Name: Erzbisch√∂fliche M√§dchenrealschule Heilig Blut Erding

   Step 3b/5: Re-fetching salt with Institution ID 358798...
            ‚úì Institution-specific salt received (468 characters)

   Step 3c/5: Re-computing hash with institution-specific salt...
            ‚úì Institution-specific hash computed (1024 characters)

   Step 3d/5: Re-authenticating with Institution ID 358798...
            ‚úì Login successful (token: ...abc12345)

   Step 4/6: Analyzing user and student data...
            ‚úì Found 1 student(s)
   ```

4. **Set up in Home Assistant**:
   - Remove old integration entry if exists
   - Add integration: Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí Add Integration ‚Üí Schulmanager Online
   - Enter credentials
   - Select school from dropdown (if multi-school)
   - ‚úÖ Should now work!

### Verification

The fix is working correctly if:
- ‚úÖ No 401 error after selecting a school
- ‚úÖ JWT token is received
- ‚úÖ Student data is loaded
- ‚úÖ Sensors appear in Home Assistant

## Impact

### Who Is Affected?

- **Affected**: Users with multi-school accounts (children at different schools)
- **Not Affected**: Users with single-school accounts (worked fine in v1.0.6)

### Backward Compatibility

‚úÖ **Fully backward compatible**

- Single-school accounts: No behavior change (`institution_id=None` works as before)
- Multi-school accounts: Now works correctly (was broken before)

## Technical Details

### Why Does the API Return Different Salts?

The Schulmanager API likely uses the `institutionId` as part of the salt generation to:
1. Ensure security per institution
2. Support different authentication policies per school
3. Isolate credentials between institutions

### Debugging Multi-School Issues

If issues persist, check debug logs:

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.schulmanager_online: debug
    custom_components.schulmanager_online.api: debug
```

Look for:
```
üßÇ Salt request payload: {'emailOrUsername': '...', 'mobileApp': False, 'institutionId': 358798}
üßÇ Salt received: 468 characters
‚úÖ Login successful, token expires at ...
```
