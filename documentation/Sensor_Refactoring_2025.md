# Sensor Refactoring 2025 - Code Deduplication and Consistency

## üéØ Problem Statement

The Home Assistant sensors had significant issues:

1. **Massive Code Duplication**: The `schedule_sensors.py` file contained 53 function definitions, with many functions duplicated 7-8 times
2. **Inconsistent Subject Handling**: The "today" sensor used abbreviated subject names while other sensors used full names
3. **Different Behavior**: Lesson attribute formatting was inconsistent across sensors
4. **Maintenance Nightmare**: Changes needed to be made in multiple places

## üîß Solution Implemented

### 1. Unified Lesson Formatting Functions

Created three core helper functions to ensure consistency:

```python
def _format_lesson_for_attributes(lesson: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Format a lesson for consistent attribute structure across all sensors."""
    
def _get_subject_for_display(lesson: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    """Get subject for display purposes (state values, summaries)."""
    
def _format_lessons_list_attributes(lessons: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Format a list of lessons with consistent attribute structure."""
```

### 2. Standardized Subject Handling

**Before**: Inconsistent behavior
- Today sensor: `"subject": "EN"` (abbreviation)
- Other sensors: `"subject": "Evangelische Religionslehre"` (full name)

**After**: Consistent across all sensors
```json
{
  "subject": "Evangelische Religionslehre (konfessionell kooperativ)",
  "subject_abbreviation": "EN"
}
```

### 3. Code Deduplication

**Before**: 
- 53 function definitions
- Functions like `get_tomorrow_lessons_count` repeated 8 times
- Functions like `get_next_school_day_lessons_count` repeated 7 times

**After**:
- 21 unique function definitions
- Each function exists only once
- Massive reduction in file size (from ~1700 lines to ~483 lines)

### 4. Consistent Lesson Attributes

All lesson sensors now use the same attribute structure:

```json
{
  "subject": "Full subject name",
  "subject_abbreviation": "Short form",
  "subject_sanitized": "Clean subject name without parentheses/commas",
  "time": "08:00-08:45",
  "room": "Room designation",
  "teacher": "Teacher abbreviation",
  "teacher_lastname": "Last name",
  "teacher_firstname": "First name",
  "is_substitution": false,
  "type": "regularLesson",
  "comment": "",
  "date": "2025-09-16",
  "class_hour": "1"
}
```

## üìä Impact Summary

### Code Quality Improvements
- ‚úÖ **Eliminated massive code duplication** (53 ‚Üí 21 functions)
- ‚úÖ **Unified data formatting** across all sensors
- ‚úÖ **Consistent subject handling** (full name + abbreviation)
- ‚úÖ **Simplified maintenance** (single source of truth)

### File Size Reduction
- **Before**: ~1700 lines with massive duplication
- **After**: ~483 lines of clean, unique code
- **Reduction**: ~72% smaller file size

### Consistency Achieved
- All sensors now use identical lesson attribute formatting
- Subject names are consistently handled across all sensors
- Time formatting is standardized as "HH:MM-HH:MM"
- Teacher information includes both abbreviation and full name

## üîÑ Migration Notes

### For Developers
- All lesson formatting now goes through unified helper functions
- Adding new lesson-based sensors is now much easier
- Changes to lesson format only need to be made in one place

### For Users
- **No breaking changes** to existing sensor entity IDs
- **Enhanced consistency** in lesson attributes across all sensors
- **Same functionality** with improved data structure

### For Home Assistant Configurations
- Existing automations and dashboards continue to work
- Enhanced data consistency may improve dashboard displays
- New `subject_abbreviation` field available for compact displays

## üöÄ Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Changes to lesson formatting only need to be made once
2. **Consistency**: All sensors behave identically regarding lesson data
3. **Performance**: Smaller file size, less memory usage
4. **Developer Experience**: Much easier to understand and modify
5. **User Experience**: Consistent data across all sensors

## üìù Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `/custom_components/schulmanager_online/schedule_sensors.py` - Major refactoring
- `/documentation/Sensors_Documentation.md` - Updated examples
- `/documentation/Sensor_Refactoring_2025.md` - This documentation

### Functions Unified
- `get_tomorrow_lessons_count` and `get_tomorrow_lessons_attributes`
- `get_next_school_day_lessons_count` and `get_next_school_day_lessons_attributes`
- `get_today_changes_attributes` now uses unified formatting
- All lesson formatting logic consolidated into helper functions

### Testing Recommendations
- Verify all sensor attributes contain consistent lesson formatting
- Check that `subject` field contains full subject names
- Confirm `subject_abbreviation` field contains short forms
- Verify `subject_sanitized` field contains clean names without parentheses/commas
- Test that time formatting follows "HH:MM-HH:MM" pattern

This refactoring ensures the Home Assistant integration is more maintainable, consistent, and easier to extend in the future.
